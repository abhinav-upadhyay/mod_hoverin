	1.	Modified module code to parse values from the querystring on the URL 
		and get the values for the the unknown fields in the HOVER variable.
		Following is the list of fields in the HOVER variable and their 
		corresponding request parameters that need to be passed with the URL:
			HOVER FIELDS				REQUEST PARAMETER NAME
			hid							hid
			site						site
			url							url
			referrer					ref
			category					cat
			theme						theme
		
	NOTE:	1. The order of these parameters on the URL does not matter.
			2. In case any or none of the parameters are supplied with the URL
				the corresponding fields will automatically get '' as their
				value.
			3. The module will be working on any requests for the hosts for which
				it is configured, even if the requested URL is not of the expected 
				format (http://<event>.hostname/<hoverlet>/<nick>/<type>/param1/).
				However we can write extra code to disable this feature if required.
	
	2.	Removed some minor bugs that were causing memory leaks and seg faults.
	
	3.	Module was getting invoked twice for each request due to some improper
		memory management, removed the bug.
			
	4. The module was changing the length of the content considerably, so made the module
		to reconfigure the Content-Length response header at the end of processing.

	1.	The module now automatically generates the JavaScript variable HOVER in
		the header, populates it with suitable values from the request URL and
		inserts it at the appropriate place in the header.
	2.	Still there are fileds left in the HOVER variable like site, referrer, etc.
		whose values are not provided currently. (The example documentation on 
		http://start.hover.in doesn't provide any example as to how these fields
		can be populated.)
	3.  Fields like Theme and hid contain values but these values may vary from 
		one request to another and currently I do not understand how to generate 
		these values.

		directives to the user at the end of installation.
	
	3.	Added support to the setup to download the header and footer files from the hover.in server from
		following URLs:
		http://start.hover.in/mod_hoverin/1/header.html

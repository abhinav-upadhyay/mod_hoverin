	1.	The module now automatically generates the JavaScript variable HOVER in
		the header, populates it with suitable values from the request URL and
		inserts it at the appropriate place in the header.
	2.	Still there are fileds left in the HOVER variable like site, referrer, etc.
		whose values are not provided currently. (The example documentation on 
		http://start.hover.in doesn't provide any example as to how these fields
		can be populated.)
	3.  Fields like Theme and hid contain values but these values may vary from 
		one request to another and currently I do not understand how to generate 
		these values.
